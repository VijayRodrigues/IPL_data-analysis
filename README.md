# IPL_data-analysis
This file consists of simple analysis between matches and deliveries csv files for the IPL from 2008 to 2017 years respectively.  

For this, I have referred to 2 datasets: matches.csv and deliveries.csv from Kaggle 

I have maed use of Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn packages and the file consists of basic analysis with graphms like bar, pie and histograms for better understanding.
